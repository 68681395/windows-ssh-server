The ConsoleHook C++ project was originally taken from the Console project on SourceForge.net <http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/>, version 2.00 build 138.
Various changes have been made to the higher-level code for the purpose of interfacing with the managed C# project of the SSH server. (The compiled ConsoleHook DLL is no longer compatible with the Console project.)
