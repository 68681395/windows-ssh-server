The ConsoleHook C++ project was originally taken from the Console project on SourceForge.net <http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/>, version 2.00 build 138.
Many changes have been made to the higher-level code for the purpose of interfacing with the managed C# project of the server. For this reason, the compiled DLL is no longer compatible with the Console project.
